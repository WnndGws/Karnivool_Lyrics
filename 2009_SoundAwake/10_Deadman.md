### Deadman

Change of the tone changing my mind\
Changing the weather\
\
I feel it at first blow from the dark\
Take it for better\
\
Still I remind myself how I define myself\
\
Black of the bruise coming up clear\
Bound to get better\
\
Blessed with the curse\
Hoping I fall, the deeper the better\
\
I needed, I needed to know\
I needed, I needed to know why\
\
Oh no, this can't be happening\
\
Pain is a door, a fever burning for more,\
A red light in my mind that I feed on\
\
You must have been so surprised to see\
There you were staring back at me\
Caught in a web now out on your own, you've got nothing to stay for, or so you keep saying\
\
This year it's coming\
And guess what we're running from\
Too late for running, the stitches are coming undone\
\
Grab your belongings, the exit is near\
Making your way through indecisiveness\
\
I needed, I needed to know\
I needed, I needed to know why\
\
Oh no, this can't be happening\
\
This myth is methodised\
You're colour blind in this madness\
Ill bide all of my time for your love\
Oh crooked man you'll die\
Like excuses pouring out a child, sing SOS you saint\
Make room for laughter, it all ends right here\
\
(SOS)\
\
This water's dark and cold\
God's not where you hoped\
His moment come and gone\
\
It's too late, mayday, call out "mayday" while I'm still alive\
Hey no matter, I don't want this to end\
I don't want this to end\
I don't want this to end\
I don't think this will end well\
\
Hey, there goes my love again\
No one's coming now\
Hey, out on my own again\
Fading faces, broken frowns\
Hey, I guess I fucked up again\
No one will find out\
Hey, stare at your feet again\
Don't say you don't know\
\
This water's dark and cold\
God's not where you hoped\
His moment come and gone\
It's time we all moved on\
\
Hey,\
\
Still I remind myself, how I define myself\
Still I remind myself, how I define myself (I needed to know)\
\
So if you like the sound of the glass that breaks against the wall\
Id trade it all for several pieces of your anger\
I am the interest of your heart\
Say this will wash away\
I'm climbing this rope, I fear god\
Would I care to stare you down?\
I portray you in a different light\
