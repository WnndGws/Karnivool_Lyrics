### The Medicine Wears Off

See what I get when the medicine wears off\
Your moving fast\
Try a little, see if I can make the moment last\
You'll burn, you'll light up like a star, and you'll break this heart you hold\
When you're coming round, you're taken by the wonder of it all\
Where are you now?\
Longing for a state of mind\
Oh I remember why we started blocking all we said\
\
See what I get when the medicine wears off\
