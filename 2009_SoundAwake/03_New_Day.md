### New Day

How did they find me?\
How did they know?\
This misconception of fate, I'm about to let go\
\
Awake in a new light I'm alone in this room\
Heavy at heart\
It may be a lie\
You will not see me\
\
It's a new day\
Why did they follow me home?\
It's a new day\
\
One more step\
It's here waiting for you\
Now go slow\
Take your time\
\
Leave no mark\
You lost your way\
I hope you're watching me\
\
One more step, It's here waiting for you\
Now go slow, Take your time\
\
Subtle breakdown from the one so free\
You lost your way\
No one held you back from me\
\
How do you all speak with a lying tongue?\
How do we all sleep with a dying sun\
\
Sit down\
Lighten your load\
This storm is coming\
You should stay home\
But I feel warmth\
\
Hey let's get lost in a crowd while searching for something worth holding\
Hey let's get lost in a crowd, I'll show you so much more\
Much more\
So much more\
\
Are we waiting for a saviour?\
Someone to heal this, or erase us\
\
How did they find me?\
How did they know?\
This misconception of fate, I'm about to let go\
\
Awake in a new light I'm alone in this room\
Heavy at heart\
It may be a lie\
You will not see me\
\
It's a new day\
\
Are we waiting for a saviour?\
I'm so sick of waiting\
I've been waiting my whole life\
\
This is a new day\
