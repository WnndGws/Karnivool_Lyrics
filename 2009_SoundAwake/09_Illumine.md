### Illumine

Don't listen\
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you\
Unspoken words that taunt you when you listen\
Forgotten words that haunt you while you're sleeping\
\
You seem afraid, don't be alarmed\
It's only the face of things to come\
\
Servant to the sun, we appease, we become as one\
Lighting ever cell, every shape\
We will never fall\
And is it relevant? Our fears and faults\
As foolish as it sounds\
\
So lead us on (there's only one way left)\
Through the free world of false promise\
Its one thing to be forgiven (there's only one way left)\
If only you could learn how to let it go\
So we are\
\
Servant of the sun, let us see we are still as one\
\
And here lie my faults, I'd give up everything to see what you see and dream of\
Why can't we dream on?\
\
Don't listen\
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you\
These words won't help to save you\
\
Servant to the sun, we appease, we become as one\
Lighting ever cell, every shape\
We will never fall\
These words won't help to save you\
Servant of the sun, let us see we are still as one\
\
You seem afraid, don't be alarmed\
It's only the face of things to come\
