### Umbra

Paint me in your own way\
Colour my eyes\
See what feelings I hide\
No one knows why no one can forgive\
Second thought, why do I care\
\
Ill hide from subtleties while I try to face my kind\
And you call this feeling\
It's not enough, come again another day\
Now that my world feels out of place will follow you home\
\
Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head\
Ill sleep til it's over and I'm sober again\
\
Safe, no I don't feel so safe here\
Imagine that everything's affected by a cause in this game you call luck\
(There's nowhere to go)\
Well I don't feel so lucky, no\
(Lie to yourself)\
Just when I think I've worked it out these pieces move and I'm back to the start\
\
Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head\
Ill sleep til it's over and I'm sober again\
Hey, it's nothing that you understand\
I promise to maybe always\
\
Do you think it matters (here I will stand)\
Do you think at all (here I will fall)\
Do we complicate it (hopeless recovery)\
Do we know at all (I'm in this hole)\
\
I don't want to\
I just have to\
I don't need it (hopeless recovery)\
I just want it\
\
Allay this troubled sinner with that gun in your hand\
Now you live for no-one knowing what you've held in your own wasted moments\
Set in stone and blood\
Hold your promise\
Save your cheap remarks, just leave me here alone\
