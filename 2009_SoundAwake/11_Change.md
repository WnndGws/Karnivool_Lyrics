### Change

(If you can just spare a little of your imagination)\
\
Hello hollow halo\
Hello (can you hear them say?) hollow halo (can you hear them calling?)\
\
You'll never, you'll never leave this world alone\
\
And I've become a martyr to the stars, become a model to the same side that I've been fighting,\
I'm still afraid to crawl on, (no more pointing fingers at mistakes, I'm)\
Drowning like a saint, I'm still afraid to fall (here in our reflection)\
\
How do you suppose, we can light the way to get us home\
What you thought was lost, now found within\
Feel this weight lift\
No more pointing fingers at mistakes, and I'm here in our reflection\
\
What a way to see this thing out\
What a way to lay this burden down\
What a way to sing this sorrow\
What a way to sing this world out\
\
Hello hollow halo\
\
And all this leads to nothing\
Still this world won't wait\
Complicated nothings\
Still this world won't wait\
\
What a way to see this thing out\
What a way to lay this burden down\
What a way to sing no tragedy\
Hello hollow halo\
\
Hello hollow halo\
Hallow (can you hear them say?) hollow halo (can you hear them calling?)\
\
(You can see all this, and watch it before your eyes,\
Everything owes its existence solely and completely to sound,\
Sound is the factor which holds it together,\
Sound is the basis of form and shape,\
Spare a little of your imagination,\
And say into the great voids of space came a sound and matter took shape\
Please watch carefully)\
\
Sine waves and mirrors,\
The smoke that you inhale\
Dry mouth and bitter tones better left unsaid\
I know this will burn you, so I become a fire\
These days will change us all\
\
Don't you feel the same, don't we fear the same things, and don't we feel the same?\
Don't you fear at all?\
\
But lately, maybe the damage has been done\
As we float like embers, beneath us the fire, still it burns\
And I don't, I don't know why, we question who we are and then we die\
I guess I'll see you when it end, ill se you round the bend my sober sorry friend\
\
Don't you feel the same? Don't we feel the same (I guess I'll see you when it ends, I'll see you round the bend my sober sorry friend)\
\
When we collide, some say goodbye, some say their worst, leaving no resolve\
There's a break in the wall, you can feel it, and it's letting us all escape\
So people tell me you need the waking day to fall asleep\
\
Light your way, find your place in you\
