### Goliath

I've warned you I've seen your ways\
Show yourself bare to the ones you make believe\
\
All I hear is the sound of sleep\
Deafening\
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams\
\
Now this won't take long\
We'll rise up again\
And rewrite these wrongs\
\
I won't do it\
I've watched you patiently guarding the life that you've deceived\
\
I've crawled for you,\
Or so they say\
We rise to it\
Fall again into the same dream\
\
You won't have to wait long\
They'll show up again\
Make way for the fall\
\
Wakeup\
There's blood in your sweat when you wakeup\
Cower blood sucking liar\
Who you gonna call when you wake up\
\
So\
What're you gonna gonna see when you wake up\
Beg you little fucking liar\
Your head on this chopping board\
\
If this is entertaining\
I hope you all enjoy the view\
\
Wide awake\
But still I sleep\
I'm failing this riddle in my head\
I'm failing to get it\
Can you see?\
Honestly\
Wide awake\
But still I sleep\
\
Don't leave this too long (this won't take long)\
Tomorrow will come (hang on)\
You won't have to wait long (rise up again)\
It's your day in the sun\
\
They've shown up again\
Please wake up\
