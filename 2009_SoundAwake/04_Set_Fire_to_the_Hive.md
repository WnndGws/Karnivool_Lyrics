### Set Fire to the Hive

I don't know what's wrong but I'm on fire\
It sears through my hands leaving skin on the wire\
\
Awake in this womb, with a crown's sting in my cell\
When I listen the same drawl plays on\
\
We're slaves in this medicated cage\
Make a decision to face this change to rules they don't explain\
So why do we obey\
\
Politics, religion, your vision's the same\
You paint us as both the cancer and the cure\
Which reminds me that it's just a game\
Your alibis are selfish\
You pretty boy, pretty face dolled up again, a star for us to adore\
And you man, you've got to be more, because this affects all\
\
It's nice to know you're with us today\
I've seen you in the fog along the way\
\
Ill spit in the mouth of your god, who whispers in the minds of the children "you've been sold again"\
Set fire to the hive as you flee\
Its fiction, a faceless illusion, you've been had again\
\
You swing this wrecking ball, a violent pendulum, to hypnotise them all\
\
The writing on the wall that we keep missing\
A structure built to fall\
Still we all obey\
\
It's nice to know you're with us today\
I've seen you in the fog along the way\
\
Ill spit in the mouth of your god, who whispers in the minds of the children "you've been sold again"\
Set fire to the hive as you flee\
Its fiction, a faceless illusion, you've been had again\
\
There's no second chances here\
