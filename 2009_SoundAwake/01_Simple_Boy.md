### Simple Boy

I'm high above the world\
Why should I feel pain?\
Or feel at all\
To be protected like a simple boy\
If I choose to let you down\
Begin to know\
\
You're free to go\
\
I will fight 'til there's nothing left.\
Watch the world together from this sinking ship or drown alone here\
On the coast facing nothingness\
Drawn to feel the emptiness\
Oh help me now, describe the scene\
\
You're free to go (Can't face this face for another day, there's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)\
You're free to go (Can't fake this face for another day, there's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)\
\
Simple boy, stay here\
Simple boy, don't wander\
Simple boy, you're safe here\
Simple boy\
\
When did we lose the plot?\
We're running against the clock, don't hesitate, or you will never go\
\
You're free to go\
Simple boy\
You're free to go\
Don't wander\
You're free to go\
Simple boy\
You're safe here\
You're free to go\
\
My Simple boy\
