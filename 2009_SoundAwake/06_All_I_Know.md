### All I Know

This is my sense of reality\
And this is proof of my coming of age\
This is truth in captivity\
And this is losing a theology\
I, I'm a soul taken, I'm a cruel, weighted mind\
This my sense of reality,\
This is proof of my coming of age\
I'm a soul taken, I a cruel, weighted mind\
\
Are you with me? Are you of like mind?\
\
Waking, falling free of gravity\
We just severed these umbilical wires\
This is more than just affinity\
We're moving further through an endless design\
I'm a soul taken, I'm a cruel weighted mind\
\
Come again, I feel afraid now, but let's go higher\
\
This is the sound of your reason to wake\
Have we forgotten now? Can we relate?\
\
Its backwards it makes no sense\
So real that we can't pretend\
Its backwards it makes no sense\
It's harder to just pretend\
\
Say it once more, say it again\
Hey, is this the end of all I know?\
\
Are you with me? (Can we relate?)\
Are you of like mind? (Can we relate?) \
\
Say it once more, say it again\
Hey, is this the end of all I know?\
