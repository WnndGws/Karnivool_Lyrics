### The Caudal Lure

Ask the question\
Are the answers loaded like this one?\
You better pull yourself along\
Time is precious and you must act\
This isn't inevitable\
\
I still stand\
I won't get back in my cell\
I will not let a saviour define my freedom\
I'm going out alone, no one is gonna save us from this\
\
We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallowed\
For all and more we set a recourse for tomorrow\
Now we could mend, will it awake this snake and follow\
\
Shatter the hourglass and what do you see\
Memories like grains of sand are blowing away\
Is this who you are? A product of fear? The shell of a man who's lost his innocence\
\
Hold your nerve, keep your focus\
There's something peculiars about the way you pay to save your soul and forfeit your dreams\
Just let it go\
\
We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallowed\
For all and more we set a recourse for tomorrow\
Now here we stand, will we embrace it or be defiant\
Final moment taken by these chemicals you can't control\
\
Ask the question\
\
We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallowed\
For all and more we set a recourse for tomorrow\
Now we could mend, will we embrace it or be defiant\
Silent moment induced by these chemicals you can't control\
\
Where's your god?\
Where's your god at all?\
