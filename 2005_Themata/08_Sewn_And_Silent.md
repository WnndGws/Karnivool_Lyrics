### Sewn and Silent

I'm touching you and tearing back,\
and dreaming of your life\
I wanted to be hurting\
Shallow eyes\
\
Not to mention I'm falling, dreaming\
What is wrong with silencing my thoughts?\
You were there, and you weren't designed for what they're selling\
\
Slow down, take time, let it heal\
Hide your face from mine\
\
I'd follow you entwined, my bleeding eyes are sewn blind\
Fade away, if you reach this in two minds\
Not to mention I'm dreaming, falling short\
Sell me away that this is real\
Saving me, settle down, and I will fall upon thee\
In this happiness I'm so damn lonely.\
\
Slow down, take time, let it heal\
Hide your face from mine\
\
It's truly devine, body and mind,\
Another reason holds you down\
Spitting it out cause I feel this love has gone astray\
Yeh darling gotta promise me now that you won't turn around\
Just as well I'm burning down\
You take me away.\
