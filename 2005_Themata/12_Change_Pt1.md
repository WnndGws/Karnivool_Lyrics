### Change Pt.1

So if you like the sound of\
The glass that breaks against the wall\
I'd trade it all for several\
Pieces of your anger\
I am the interest of your heart\
Say this will wash away\
I'm climbing this rope, I feel God\
Would you care to stare me down?\
I portray you in different light\
