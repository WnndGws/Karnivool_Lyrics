### Roquefort

You want to chase this rabbit down a hole\
You start to slide and lose grip of control\
Make haste, it's time, to ruin or reward\
You say "give in" but then you beg for more\
\
You'll bury this, slow down\
It's all this system breeds\
You'll bury this, slow down, it's time to make amends\
Save your eyes for this place where I define you\
Myth or desire\
When it's true love you held dear, feel it arising\
\
So cut me, to size, I'm losing shape through all this\
You call me sublime, you know that's such a waste of energy\
Will I change your mind if I could show you my way?\
A black stain on your heart, you know that's not what I want to see.\
You'll bury this, slow down, it's time to make amends\
(Always in vain now)\
\
Save your eyes for this place where I define you\
Myth or desire\
When it's true love, you held dear, fear your horizons\
\
You want to chase, this rabbit down a hole\
You start to slide and lose grip of control\
Make haste, it's time to ruin or reward\
You say "give in" but then you beg for more\
\
You'll bury this, slow down, it's time to make amends\
I crave you\
\
Set your eyes on this place where I define you\
Myth or desire\
When it's true love, you feel\
\
Feel it rising\
