### Mauseum

Run within us, run with spite\
Set your eyes upon it\
Now with you agrieved, I see through your eyes, I need\
I will not be the fallen\
\
From this Moses basket\
I should have felt something\
I should have done something\
After I fall will you be there?\
\
Run within us, run with sight\
Set your eyes upon it\
So breathe in silently, fade all colour from my skin\
To reflect from within\
\
From this moses basket\
I should have felt something\
I should have done something, after I fall\
Will you be there?\
\
Shall I free it\
Shall I be it?\
Sometimes I miss you\
I feel it\
Reflect from within\
\
So come down, breathe in, die slow\
I should have felt something in my own mind\
I should have felt something\
So come down, see them die slow\
\
In the end it will surely break you\
Show me power and I'll show you being\
In the end it all amounts to nothing\
Helpless it's coming on\
