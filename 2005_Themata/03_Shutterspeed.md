### Shutterspeed

Leave me alone, I'm seething\
I search for the truth and love in your eyes\
Help me to feel I'm needed\
I search for the truth to find you mine\
\
Bust myself back into pieces\
I pull at the seam as you start to tear\
Lead myself back to a coma shell\
No better face left to bare\
I see more than you\
And I feel more than you\
Your spinning me out\
\
It's a better room now, it's a better place\
I would beg you to scream at me\
The voices cry, the fashion moulds\
They want the truth, not what it seems\
\
Bust myself back into pieces\
I pull at the seam as you start to tear\
Lead myself back to my coma shell\
No better face left to bare\
I see more than you\
And I feel more than you\
Your spinning me out\
\
Speak to me now\
With guided tongue\
See through me now\
Look what you've done\
\
I see more than you (more than you)\
And I feel more than you (more than)\
\
Scrape me from the ceiling\
These suckers want more\
I feel the pressure belonging to all\
Put fear in to my mind\
I'm open to everything\
I feel the strength of you\
Give me this feeling I need yeah\
\
It's a better room now, it's a better place\
I feel more than you\
