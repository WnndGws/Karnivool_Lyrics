It's treading with a piece\

So sing it with your soul\
It's coming and it's never late when I come home\

It's better than the last time that I tried\
So sing it with your soul\
It's coming it's never late\
When I\
It's running with a smile\
It's better than the last time that I tried\
So sing it with your soul\
And it's coming it's never late when I come home\

Help me I need light\
