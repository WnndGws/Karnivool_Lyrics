You relate through just the bloodline\
When you can never take anything that I give\
Always wanting to relate through me\
I go watch you slowly slip away\
\
You're all wanting to put your trust in me\
I can feel this remedy kickin on\
Just to taste it, just to want it\
And I can me say it's not my fault\
\
Say youre sorry\
When i'm coming down\
Not again it's so lifelike\
\
Come make it alright\
When I'm coming down\
Not again I'm fragile\
\
Would you choose me or just abuse me?\
When I can never take anything that you give\
Always wanting to relate through me\
I go watch you slowly slip away\
\
You're all wanting to put your trust in\
When I can feel this remedy kickin on\
Just to taste it, just to want it\
And I can me say it's not my fault\
\
Say youre sorry\
When i'm coming down\
Not again it's so lifelike\
\
Come make it alright\
When I'm coming down\
Not again I'm fragile\
\
You see I'll be the one in your darkest time\
\
Should I begin to erase myself?\
I'm caught in this picture of you\
Should I begin to assess myself?\
Tell me it's over\
\
It comes from above with this feeling\
It takes you away and it buries your soul again\
Your now blessed by ignorance\
Yes you want to\
\
So run with me if you must follow\
I'll take you away to this place where we can be free\
A place I call ecstasy\
\
Now you lie alone\
Your chance to stop and stare\
God, I'd kiss your bones\
Now say it's not my fault\
\
Say youre sorry\
When I'm coming down\
Not again it's so lifelike\
\
Come make it alright\
When i'm coming down\
Not again i'm fragile\
