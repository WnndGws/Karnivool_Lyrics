### FOTS

In your own state of mind\
All you feel now is one\
A conscious world will spin you in and out of time\
Lend your breath to a broken sail\
Hands up, ????\
Rolling water, suck her free\
Surely I can make you feel what I'm feeling, falling in\
Comfort bleeds a swollen mend\
In the secrecy that is to lie\
Knowing in failure, will I forge the wrong sound?\
Soon I see what they mean\
Living this fallacy\
Promised heaven, I concede.\
Dead, what I'm feeling, falling in\
Comfort bleeds a swollen mend\
In the secrecy that is to lie\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes\
With you in mind, with you in time\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your head\
Dead, what I'm feeling, falling in\
Comfort bleeds a swollen mend\
In the secrecy that it's to lie\
That is to lie\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes\
With you in mind, with you in time\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your head\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes\
With you in mind, with you in time\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your head\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes\
With you in mind, yeah with you in time\
Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your head\
