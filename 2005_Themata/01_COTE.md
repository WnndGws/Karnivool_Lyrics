### C.O.T.E

Are you willing to choose what I have in my mind?\
Say it loud, with a voice with no reason in mind\
And I suppose this question will be answered\
And I suppose the answers' here to save us\
Have you heard, have you listened lately?\
Single word, single vowel, yet nothing frustrates me\
\
Now I don't think you like me now\
\
Have you heard, it's a silent dream\
It chooses the weather, of your soul stream\
So drop me down, let me feel this either way\
Face me inside, with a broken view, a broken heart\
Disappear\
\
Now I don't think you like me now\
Now I don't think you're like me now\
\
Hold it, Hold it\
(I won't leave you)\
Now hold it down, please\
\
Sing along, sing aloud, to be alive, its so good to feel you near\
Swim alone, live a dream, see me drown\
All this in apathy\
Be still for a moment\
So you can face this world, you face it all for a moment\
So you can face this world, you face this world\
\
Hold it, Hold it\
(I won't leave you)\
Now hold it down, please\
