### Themata

Step in this room where I want to be\
Show me you mean this is something\
You're bringing me down to a silent breath and it's the truth that I want to see\
\
Search myself for the reason, the ever loving greed\
I am put off slighty, So what am I to see, oh my love\
(In the sensory serenity)\
\
So pull the pin inside\
Baby let it ride\
Never knowin' I'm the next to see\
With the fire sign\
Never make it mine\
Never knowin' I'm the next to be\
\
I am learning slowly\
So what am I to see\
Every twist\
And turning through my hypocrisy\
\
It's so good to see this world is alive\
It's so good to see this world is a lie\
\
Like a knot it binds, suffocating minds\
Never knowing, I'm in exstacy\
With the fire sign\
Never make it mine\
Never knowin' I'm the next to bleed\
\
I am learning slowly\
So what am I to see\
Every twist and turning\
Through my hypocrisy\
Search myself for the reason\
Forever loving greed\
I am bored of silence\
So what am I to see?\
\
It's so good to see this world is alive\
It's so good to see this world is a lie\
\
Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe\
Show me you mean this is something\
You're bringing me down to a silent breath\
and it's the truth that I want to see\
In the sensory serenity\
How could it be, that I'm in ecstasy\
In the sensory, serenity\
How could it be, that I'm in ecstasy\
\
It's so good to see this world is alive\
It's so good to see this world is a lie\
It's so good to see (So good to see)\
This world I'm in loves me so\
