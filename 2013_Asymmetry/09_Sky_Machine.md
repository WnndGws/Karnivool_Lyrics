### Sky Machine

I keep staring at the sky\
I've been waiting for some time\
So out of touch\
So out of mind\
I can feel you there\
I wont lie\
We're all just kids\
We're all good liars\
\
Please try to understand, there is no great plan\
We have no idea what lies beyond our reach\
Try to understand, there is no great plan\
We will cross the line with an open mind\
\
Show me what it is\
Hush my desires\
Set me on fire\
\
Please try to understand, there is no great plan\
We have cast our eyes to the open skies\
Try to understand, we've another plan\
We have crossed the line with an open mind\
\
We have crossed the line\
\
You're new to me\
And I believe you have to be the one we need\
\
Soon you will see it when all our reasons for trying are justified\
We'll hold the fate of the world\
The dearly departed, the wont make a sound\
\
You are the same as the salt blood running in our veins\
Few have the heart of the brave\
Now will you run or stay\
We hide away our vicious things, don't let them out\
Even the ones that we don't see who are always there\
\
You're new to me\
And I believe you have to be the one we need\
Take me with you on this sky machine\
I'm dying to know where you're from\
And what it is we seek\
\
Soon you will see it when all our reasons for trying are justified\
We'll hold the fate of the world\
The dearly departed, the wont make a sound\
