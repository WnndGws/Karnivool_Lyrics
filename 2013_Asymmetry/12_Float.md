### Float

Not ever, no never, not ever will they know this love\
What they wanted was a sign that they could hear everlasting a refrain they sing aloud to\
\
All we want is just enough to get by\
We all pretend to understand it\
To give us the feeling like we wont allow it\
Forever and ever\
Forever will they know this slight\
Cornered enough to make a sound\
Hear it everlasting, a refrain they're not allowed to have enough\
Just enough to get by\
The freedoms we're ever chasing\
Just when the feeling strikes we're not around it\
\
Cornered enough to make a sound\
Just to hear them live it\
The refrain they sing aloud to\
Just enough to get by\
