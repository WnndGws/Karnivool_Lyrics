### The Refusal

We are a broken wrung\
We both compose the wreckage\
\
There aint nothing you can say to prove I held the rope that let you down\
As we crash into the waves and drown\
This isn't possible\
\
So if there's any doubt\
I will throw you a line\
Excuses, Excuses\
Don't ever remind me, how it is and always will be\
\
You've been this way before\
The shadows here all know you\
I don't know what you've had or what it is inside you\
But we are all around you\
\
If love comes first, maybe our lies will dissolve\
Young fruit still not bruised\
Hey maybe, just maybe, we all make our moves\
And mine could have helped you\
I could have helped you\
\
We are a broken wrung\
We both compose the wreckage\
\
There aint nothing you can say to prove I held the rope that let you down\
As we crash into the waves and drown\
This isn't possible\
