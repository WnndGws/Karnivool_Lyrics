### A.M. War

If we live to see another year, will it really make much difference?\
Oh they say "no it wouldn't change a single thing"\
We live every other day like it's every other day\
\
Enough said\
Can I be honest?\
We'd love you to stay, but if you can't respect the life held in your hand, we must walk away\
\
Another clotted blot of colour on the scenery\
You're no visionary\
Just a blur on the scenery\
Flawed by design\
\
All things aside\
We're almost out of time\
One more day to see through\
Now we've learned things are not OK\
We will say goodbye\
We're almost out of time\
In this hopeless cold divide\
Something moves inside, I swear it's under my skin\
\
I've got to get out of the way\
Flawed by design\
Don't want you to stay\
\
Another clotted blot of colour on the scenery\
You're no visionary\
Just a blur on the scenery\
Flawed by design\
\
If it matters to you\
Don't waste time, just be ready\
Because we're leaving here with nothing\
If it matters to you\
Make your peace, or drown in decay\
We've got to get out of the way\
