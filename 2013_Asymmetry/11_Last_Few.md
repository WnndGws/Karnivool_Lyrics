### The Last Few

Some of you will get out alive, though you'll bare all the cost\
I promise you all your scars will be worth all your loss\
\
We've taken the fall to save our skin\
We've stomached them all, these precious medicines\
Sick as we are, we are strong\
\
Our freedom comes when this anthem is sung, when the fakes come undone because we have switched the light on\
We've exposed our friends in arms, now we stand as one at the end\
\
If we are the last few who'll be the first one to lead us\
If we are the last few\
New life, new life\
One chance to prove we are so fiercely committed to new life, new life\
We're alone and committed to new life, new life\
\
If we are the last few\
Now we're alone and committed\
We are the last few\
New life, new life\
