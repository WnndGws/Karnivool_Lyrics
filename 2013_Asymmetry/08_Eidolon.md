### Eidolon

I couldn't hide my face to claim my innocence\
I wouldn't have the sense to keep going on\
Maybe I'm just to proud to stand in your defense\
Still I feel the pull of hidden wires\
\
I'm never going to try\
I lied, I dared to speak my mind\
When all the old changes made before don't seem to change a thing at all\
\
Are you real?\
\
I wouldn't find my place with this poor disguise\
Why can't I face myself without these lies?\
I couldn't find my path without knowing it\
I've been round every turn, I know what's left is right\
\
I'll never let it die\
I tried, I dared to free my mind\
All the same changes made before don't seem to change a thing at all\
\
I'm never going to try\
I know that I wont go back\
It started with a smile\
I know, but it wont come back\
\
I should have seen it coming\
Now I'm feeling nothing\
I was taken far beneath the middle\
\
I'm never going to try\
I know that I wont go back\
It started with a smile\
I know, but it wont come back\
