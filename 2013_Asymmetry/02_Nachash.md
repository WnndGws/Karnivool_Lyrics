### Nachash

Subtle wave in motion shaping spirals upon the ground\
Where our eyes are drawn a circular door forms\
\
Here we go\
Our minds recoil out of control in this spinning wheel\
We're starting to face what we've feared and what we can't ignore\
\
It's starting to swell, this is bigger than you\
Who thought it could be something beautiful\
It's beginning to feel like we're part of something real\
\
Red eyes shift to signal the sun raise it's phoenix call to fracture my sleep\
Now the shaking sky means the shows just starting\
We'll awake to carry the weight of our promises\
\
I feel it taking over\
\
I'm feeling opaque as my colours all fade to grey\
Here in the light of my darkest day it's silent\
I center my thoughts so maybe I can relax into my sigh\
My mind's always window shopping but I can't afford the payments\
I feel like I've wasted my last chance to try\
Awake, I'm here in this moment, this pivotal moment\
It's taking me over\
\
It's starting to swell, this is bigger than you\
Who thought it could be something beautiful\
It's beginning to feel like we're part of something real\
