### Alpha Omega

Hopeless in deep space\
You made us wait like you used to\
Our world's an utter disgrace\
You made us sing hallelujah and now it's all gone\
Everytime we've tried\
\
We cannot pity, we cannot stand around\
Nervous for the hope we're yet to find everytime we try\
\
Which one are you, two sides of a coin\
Taking pride in plenty of good advice\
Win or lose our minds\
It aint picture perfect\
Everytime we've tried\
Nervous for the hope we're yet to find everytime we try\
\
We've got to set all feelings aside\
Where every new life rises, we all build together\
Win or lose our minds\
It aint picture perfect\
Everytime I try\
\
Break the mould, let's shake the ground, wreak havoc\
Waiting, watching for good news\
\
We all strike a match that burns this ordinary life\
When the sun rises high you best pray you're the better man\
We've all got to take to the wall\
Break free and burn it to the ground\
\
This aint no ordinary life\
