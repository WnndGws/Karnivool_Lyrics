### Aeons

I think there's a pulse\
But I don't remember feeling anything close to this\
I don't know if it's worthwhile but I hope so\
Because I don't feel so well, No I don't feel so well\
\
We've got to keep a grip on this\
Or the rising tide could still pull us underneath, and leave us to the ocean\
Either way\
I'm starting to feel that something's wrong with this poison\
Because in my veins it's burning\
\
I hope you hold a place for us\
Far enough away from all the flames they like to tell us burn\
I hope you hold a way for us\
Because I don't really know you, I don't really know you\
\
Why the hell did I seek the truth\
All I've seen in it's reflection\
Still part of me regrets it\
I just wanted to see, now it's clear we're alone in this\
\
It's your funeral\
It's your dying day\
So make amends for the end will leave us nothing\
It's your funeral\
It's your dying day\
So make amends, one last spin, then leave with nothing\
\
When I breathe again, will my lungs fill with fire?\
When I breathe again I hope it's ok\
When I see again\
When smoke clears who will still remain here?\
When I see again I hope it's ok\
\
Chemical fires will signal we're dead\
Chemical fires will signal we're dead and gone\
\
